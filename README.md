Netflix and Chill
===================

This repo was created to store my project for my Computer Organization and Architecture class. In it, you will find my project document in PDF and pages form, the .cpp files used with my Arduino, and images used in the project document.


Note: You MUST first install the [IRLib2](#IRLib2) Library as it is nessecary to run my files. Also. Shoutout to IRLib2 for having this library free and open source with great documentation!
